Ingredients:
 1 cup	chopped onions
½ cup chopped carrots
½ cup	diced celery
3 Tbsp chopped bell peppers
2 tsp minced garlic
1 cup diced tomatoes
½ cup	crushed tomatoes
1 Tbsp sunflower oil
2¼ cup canned chickpeas (with liquid)
¾ cup	canned black beans (drained)
1 cup	canned kidney beans (drained)
2 tsp chili powder 
1 tsp	ground cumin 
¾ tsp	ground coriander
½ tsp	oregano
pinch	thyme
pinch	ground bay leaf
pinch	sea salt
pinch	black peppercorn

Directions:
1. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, heat up your oil.
2. Add your veggies and sweat them, covered, until they’re soft and translucent. 
   Chef Speak: ‘sweating’ veggies is like sautéing, but without browning them. It helps to bring out their flavours.
3. Add the remaining ingredients (beans and spices), and bring to a simmer.
4. Lower the heat and continue simmering (covered) for 30 minutes.
